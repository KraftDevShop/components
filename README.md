# Components
This repo serves as a bin for components that we find useful and highly repeatable. It's a good practice to focus on developing existing base, polishing ideas rather than rewriting it all from scratch with every next project. Feel free to use the snippets in your own projects or to make a PR with something intresting discovered in your daily workflows.
